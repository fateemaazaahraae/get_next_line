<p><i>Reading a line on a fd is way too tedious </i><p><br>
<h1>ðŸ’¡ About the project : </h1><br>
<p>You will understand how files are opened, read and closed in an OS,
and how they are interpreted by a programming language for further analysis.
This task is crucial to understand for a future programmer since much of the time is based
on manipulating files for data management and persistence. <br>
This project consists of coding a function that returns one line at a time from a text file.</p> <br><br>
